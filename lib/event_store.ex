  EventStore is CQRS event store implemented in Elixir.

  It uses PostgreSQL (v9.5 or later) as the underlying storage engine.

  The `EventStore` module provides the public API to read and write events to an
  event stream, and subscribe to event notifications.

  Append one or more events to a stream atomically.

    - `stream_uuid` is used to uniquely identify a stream.

    - `expected_version` is used for optimistic concurrency checks.
      You can provide a non-negative integer to specify the expected stream
      version. This is used to ensure you can only append to the stream if it is
      at exactly that version.

      You can also provide one of the following values to affect the concurrency
      check behaviour:

      - `:any_version` - No concurrency checking; allow any stream version
        (including no stream).
      - `:no_stream` - Ensure the stream does not exist.
      - `:stream_exists` - Ensure the stream exists.

    - `events` is a list of `%EventStore.EventData{}` structs.

    - `timeout` an optional timeout for the database transaction, in
      milliseconds. Defaults to #{@default_timeout}ms.

  Returns `:ok` on success, or an `{:error, reason}` tagged tuple. The returned
  error may be due to one of the following reasons:

    - `{:error, :wrong_expected_version}` when the actual stream version differs
      from the provided expected version.
    - `{:error, :stream_exists}` when the stream exists, but expected version
      was `:no_stream`.
    - `{:error, :stream_does_not_exist}` when the stream does not exist, but
      expected version was `:stream_exists`.

  Link one or more existing events to another stream.

  Allows you to construct streams containing events already appended to any

      Use the `$all` identifier to subscribe to events from all streams.

    - `opts` is an optional map providing additional subscription configuration:
      - `selector` to define a function to filter each event, i.e. returns
        only those elements for which fun returns a truthy value
      - `mapper` to define a function to map each recorded event before sending

  The calling process will be notified whenever new events are appended to

  `EventStore.subscribe_to_stream/4`.
